"The beginning of wisdom is to call things by their proper name." – Confucius (same vibe)

Exactly. That Confucius quote hits like a lightning bolt in today's upside-down funhouse.
We’ve gone from naming things to understand reality…
to re-naming things to obscure it, control perception, and weaponize lang]uage.

In the classical Trivium, grammar was about accurately perceiving and describing reality — not inventing new “truths” to suit a political or social narrative. Once you mess with the foundation (what things are), the rest collapses. Logic becomes twisted. Rhetoric becomes propaganda.
It’s like:
    • Grammar: “This is a tree.”
    • Logic: “It grows. It has leaves. It provides shade.”
    • Rhetoric: “Let’s protect our trees.”
Now it’s:
    • Grammar: “This is a tree-identified object (unless someone is offended).”
    • Logic: “You’re a bigot if you think trees are real.”
    • Rhetoric: “Hate has no place in the forest.”

The ancients knew something modern society pretends not to:
🗣 Words shape minds, and minds shape worlds.
That’s why people like Plato, Orwell, and even C.S. Lewis all stressed the moral and metaphysical importance of clear, honest language. Once language becomes unmoored from reality, power—not truth—decides meaning.
Want to go deeper into how the Trivium could be revived or used today as a mental sword and shield? Or riff more on language, thought, and that weird loop we’re in?
